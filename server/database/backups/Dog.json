    "bio": "Hi there! My name is Red Baron. The nice folks at CBR have helped me out of a bad situation and I intend to take advantage of my second chance. No looking back. No more being chained outside. No more sleeping on the cold, hard ground. No more going to sleep hungry. That’s the best part, cause I really like food! At my foster home, I have my own soft bed and my own den, they call a crate. It’s pretty nice I guess, as long as I can have my Nylabone to chew on! It’s a pretty nice place to sleep in at night. It beats sleeping outside, I can tell you that! I go for leisurely walks every day. I like that too! I went to a clinic yesterday and they gave me some medicine to get rid of the worms in my belly.",

The dog park is the best.  I think I’m fast but my friend Tucker is even faster.  Did I mention that I like to play?  I’d rather play with a tennis ball or chew toy than your shoes.  I realize that’s a no-no.  I’m not a bad dog, I'm a good dog.  While I have white fur that shows dirt, this does not mean that I am a bad dog.  I’m happy outside or inside.  I will let others know not to mess with my family with my powerful bark!  ARF!!",

Don't be fooled though I dream a lot...my crates rocks and rolls all night and I wake myself up howling softly at the moon.

It does not wake anyone up, we have just heard it when he goes to sleep while we are still awake.) Boomer here again, yeah see these new people right? Well they got something called A/C. Yeah, yeah I heard of it before, but never had much experience with being outside a lot and all. I got it made in the shade now, hehehe, I'm kind of on the funny side.",
